Module 2 Brainstorm
My name is Dolan and I am 25 years old. I was born and raised here in Tucson and I love it here. Some of my hobbies include watching football, playing sports, playing video games, and collecting Funko pops as well as football cards. I currently work as an administrative assistant for Premise Health at the Raytheon Tucson Airport site, and have been in this role for almost two years now. I am hoping to earn my Associate's degree from Pima by next fall, and then to transfer to the University of Arizona to earn my Bachelor's degree. I look forward to learning more about programming and computers in general!
